### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br>

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in **Computer Science** from the **University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)**, completed in August 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with **University of SÃ£o Paulo** and **University of Campinas (Recod.ai)** on research projects focusing on **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**.

I have professional experience as a **Software Engineer** and **Computer Vision Engineer**. Currently, I am part of **Bosch Germany**'s PreMaster program, as a **Data Engineer**, where I am gaining hands-on experience within an international team while preparing for my Masterâ€™s studies.
